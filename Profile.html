						<h2>Related questions from the tests</h2><br>
						<div align=left>
							Honestly my belief in these kinds of tests is limited, though I understand they are
							sometimes
							used in job interviews so being familiar could make things go smoother.
							<br><br>I have actually been denied a job for failing a personality test before despite
							already
							subcontracting to the company for 6 months and having a good working relationship with the
							employees. Upper management said the rules were not flexible so I had to move on, though
							I’ve worked at my current similar job for around 10 years with no issues making me
							wonder
							what the tests showed.
							<br><br>That’s not to say I don’t think they have any value, but only as a starting point or
							rough
							guide. Of course I must be ready to still deal with them for companies that use them.
							<br><br><b>• What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b><br>
							<br>Most the results are roughly what I expected to see.
							The Myers test showed “The Commander” but to me it seems to be very middle of the road
							likely showing that I don’t fit into the role very well. For example, I am known to lead but
							also more than happy to follow someone who knows what they are doing. Very situation
							dependent.
							<br><br>The Learning style with the focus on Tactile, then Visual and finally Auditory is
							just what
							I expected as I do tend to be more interested when actively participating. I actually
							believe this kind of test can be more useful than the others and I’ve been learning
							more about my learning style lately.
							<br><br>Last the Big Five personality test shows a rough idea of what I expected but fails
							to go
							into detail. For example in a social situation where I share a common interest with people I
							may be very loud and out going. In a work environment I’m more likely to avoid social
							interaction beyond what is required for the job and to be polite.
							<br><br><b>• How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team?</b><br>
							<br>I honestly don’t think it will but to play along. To start the Myers-Briggs Test show I
							would fit into the role of group leader but not to such an extreme level that I couldn’t
							fill another position if required. I would also do well to assist with organisation of roles
							and the best way to arrange tasks. The Learning Style test shows I would be best remaining
							on the more active side of preparing all the work and presentations to assist all the
							information sticking in my memory long term, the more I have to put it to practical
							use the better. Last the Big Five test again shows that I’m a middle of the road person in
							many areas but should watch out for withdrawing from the group too much.
							<br><br><b>• How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b><br>
							<br>I believe the results show I am rather flexible from all the tests so I would do best
							trying to fill in any missing areas from other team members. For maximising the learning
							side though I am keen to take more of a role in the creation and implication of any of the
							ideas developed and researched, so should try to find a group lacking too many with similar
							ambitions. For this courses project I’m looking forward to assisting
							heavily in
							developing the video presentation. Last I should use my calm and agreeable personality to
							try and assist with any tensions that my group may develop and this could help me form a
							team that otherwise would have trouble getting along.
