						<b>Name - </b> Timothy J Forde <br>
						<b>Student Number - </b> s3304381 <br>
						<b>Email Address - </b> s3304381@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
						I’ve always lived in Australia with most of that time in Melbourne and a small amount in
						Brisbane. I have a European background and only speak English. <br>
						<b>Formal Education</b> <br>
						Approximately 1.5 years finished of a mechanical engineering degree. <br>
						Some single subjects in electronics, chemistry and astronomy. <br>
						Many short security courses over the last 13 years covering areas such as conflict resolution,
						control room operation, first aid, maritime security, x-ray screening, crowd control e.c.t. <br>
						And some basic Combat Engineer training during my time in the Australian Army Reserves.<br>
						<b>Work History</b> <br>
						I have worked in the security industry for many different company’s over 13 years covering a
						large variety of roles from clubs, events, maritime, control room and corporate. <br>
						<b>Hobbies</b> <br>
						I’ve always had some interesting hobbies starting with my time in combat robotics when I was
						younger learning many practical engineering skills. I tend to love pulling things apart and
						trying to put them back together. <br>
						For the last 4 years I have gotten involved with computer gaming focus content creation on both
						YouTube and the streaming website Twitch.tv where I become partnered. This has help me learn
						many areas of video production and even some basic marketing, as well as my ability to engage an
						audience. <br>
						Streaming alas has been put on hold while I get into this course and sort out a few more life
						matters but I look forward to returning soon. My under-construction wordpress based website for
						this content can be found here <a href="http://www.merc.gg">www.merc.gg</a><br>
