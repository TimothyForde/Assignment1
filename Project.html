					<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
					<span class="byline">An idea to pitch I think has value</span>
				</div>
				<h3>Overview</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					My planned project idea is to develop the software to run a security officers patrol automated
					pathing system.
					<br> It would allow supervisors to have fine control over the area’s security officers patrol
					and their frequency, as well as keep those paths random and more interesting.
					<br>
					<br>The device would also be able to double as a welfare device, noteing when a guard has not
					moved for a set time and requiring interaction or sending an alert. This alert could also be
					triggered manually if required.
					<br>It could also include use of built in sensors that would also detect any falls from height that
					may
					have caused injury.
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Motivation</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					This project would assist in many areas but to cover a few.
					<br><br>
					The supervisor would have complete control over what areas are to be patrolled with easy
					modifying from day to day depending on changing situations.
					<br><br>
					Patrols would remain random making it harder for criminals to predict security activity.
					<br><br>
					The random nature would assist with repetitive strain injuries by forcing the patrols to have
					variety as well as much the shift more interesting.
					<br><br>
					Records would protect both the supervisor and security officer in the case of any incidents and
					questions of locations and priority areas.
					<br><br>
					The extra fall and duress ability would add safety.
					<br><br>
				</div>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<div align=left>
					<br>In greater detail this project would track and provide new instructions to security officers
					currently on patrol around a location.
					<br>
					<br>The process for a security officer -
					<br>
					<br>At the start of a patrol the officer would activate the application.
					The application would assess the current location, as well as the pre in build variables set by
					the site supervisor, and give a patrol path instruction to the officer.
					<br>Fom example patrol building 1 levels 2-3-4 counter clockwise.
					<br>The officer would follow this path and on reaching the end trigger the device again. That
					part
					could be done automatically by GPS or manually depending on what is possible.
					<br>The device would then select a new patrol path based on the variables once again.
					<br>For example, do an external patrol of building 2, 3, 4 clockwise.
					This cycle would continue and covers the basic functionality.
					<br>
					<br>The process for the supervisor –
					<br>
					<br>First the site and all desired patrol paths would need to be programmed in. Once entered
					though
					these kinds of variable would rarely change. Patrol times would also need to be calulacted so the
					program could take these into account.
					<br>Then different priorities for each area would need to be set, this changing the chance of
					the
					program picking a location to be patrolled next.
					<br>Last any minimum patrol requirements set. Such as a hallway needing to be patrolled every 12
					hours, or a set of locks checked every hour for signs of damage.
					<br>
					<br>Process for the program –
					<br>
					<br>When working out the patrol route the program would consider a mixture of priority levels,
					time
					requirements, and the last recorded patrol.
					<br>Any upcoming time requirements would take priority based off what is coming up as due. Then
					priority levels and time since last recorded patrol would be combined and the area randomly
					selected.
					<br><br>
					A formula such as this could be used. 1 being low priority and 5 being high.
					<br>Location selection chance = priority * last patrol.
					<br>Example Section chance 20 = priority 5 * 4 hours
					<br>The program would calculator that for all locations and then pick randomly with the larger the
					number the more chance of being selected. The clockwise or contraclockwise and up or down could be
					randomly selected.
					<br>This means the longer an area has not been checked the greater chance of selection, but it
					is
					also possible to double back on a location that has just been visited to keep this random.
					And the higher the priority of an area the greater change of it being selected for a patrol.
					<br>All the data would be uploaded and record on servers in case it ever is required, or live
					updates could even be sent to a control room to be aware of officer locations.
					Bonus features
					<br><br>
					The program could also be watching the phones accelerometer sensors to watch out for any sudden
					change in velocity that could indicate a fall or long times without movement, sending an alert
					to check if the officer is ok
					before possible on a lack of response to the control room.
					<br>Then an emergency button could be built into the program to also send the alert in case an
					incident happens that does not allow the guard time or ability to communicate on the radio. A
					simple trigger device could likely be connected to the phones audio jack or as a Bluetooth
					device.
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
				<div align=left>
					<br>Though there would be many ways to build this system one allowing the greatest adoption
					would
					likely be based around integration with a mobile phone device.
					<br><br>A small device could be made that would likely be more reliable, but for wider adoption
					using
					the sensors and commination already built into a mobile phone would likely be best.
					<br><br>Likely with an Android focus at the start due to the more rugged and cheaper availability of
					phones though room to expand to IOS could be possible later. This mean Java on the phone side
					would likely be used along with bluetooth and sensor technologies built in.
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Skills required</h3>
				<div align=left>
					<br>Depends on the end goal the lists is long but as a basic start.
					In depth Java programming as well as knowledge of how to write Android applications with it and
					interface them with the phone sensors.
					<br><br>Web development and server knowledge to allow the phone to communicate back with a server as
					required for new instructions and to update past history. As well as being able to make a basic
					desktop application to allow retrieval of data and putting in new patrol variables.
				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<div align=left>
					<br>If this project was developed also the basic criteria at the overview would be met. Security
					Company’s seeking greatly safety and control of Security Officers would likely adopt it due to a
					possible low starting cost. This would make the security provided more effective.
					<br>
					<br>Long term hardware solutions removed from the phone would likely be developed having better
					durability and price advantages, or to be used in places a phone cannot. Integration into
					existing security software solution could also be investigated opening new possible
					functionality with access control systems and alarms.
