					<h1>Project Ideas</h1>
					<span class="byline">An idea to pitch I think has value</span>
				</div>
				<h3>Overview</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					My planned project idea is to develop the software to run an automated security patrol pathing
					system.<br>
					It would allow supervisors to have fine control over the area’s security officers patrol, their
					frequency, and keep those paths random and more interesting.<br>
					<br>
					The device would also be able to double as a welfare check, noting when a guard has not moved for a
					set time and requiring interaction or sending an alert to a control room. This alert could also be
					triggered manually if required.<br>
					It could also include use of built in sensors that would detect any falls from height that may have
					caused injury.

				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Motivation</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					The project would increase efficiency, control and safety of many security operations.<br>
					<br>
					With it the supervisor would have complete control over what areas are to be patrolled with easy modification
					from day to day adapting easily to changing situations and priorities. <br>
					<br>
					Patrols would remain random making it harder for criminals to predict security activity. <br>
					<br>
					The random nature would reduce repetitive strain injuries and make the job more interesting by
					assisting the patrols to have variety. <br>
					<br>
					Records would protect both the supervisor and security officer in the case of any incidents and
					questions of locations and areas given priority. <br>
					<br>
					The extra fall and duress ability would add safety.

					<br><br>
				</div>
				<h3>Description</h3> <br>
				<div align=left>
					To go into greater detail, I’m going to cover how the program would function and how it would affect
					security officers and their supervisors.<br>
					<br>
					Process for a security officer -<br>
					<br>
					At the start of a patrol the officer would activate the phone application. The program would assess
					the current location, the pre in build variables set by the site supervisor, and give a patrol path
					instruction to the officer.
					For example patrol building 1 levels 2-3-4 counter clockwise.<br>
					<br>
					The officer would follow this path and on reaching the end trigger the device again. That part could
					be done automatically by GPS or manually depending on what is possible.<br>
					<br>
					A new path would be sent such as, do an external patrol of building 2, 3, 4 clockwise. This cycle
					would continue and covers the basic functionality.
					Each time a patrol is finished the application would also report the completion back to the server.<br>
					<br>
					Process for the supervisor –<br>
					<br>
					First the site and all desired patrol paths would need to be programmed in. Once entered though
					these kinds of variables would rarely change. Patrol times would also need to be calculated so the
					program could take these into account.<br>
					<br>
					Then different priorities for each area would need to be set, this changing the chance of the
					program picking a location to be patrolled next.<br>
					<br>
					Last any minimum patrol requirements set. Such as a hallway needing to be patrolled every 12 hours,
					or a set of locks checked every hour for signs of damage.<br>
					<br>
					If something like a high risk laboratory was being used that night a 30 minute welfare check could
					be temporarily added.<br>
					<br>
					Process for the program – <br>
					<br>
					When working out the patrol route the program would consider a mixture of priority levels, time
					requirements, and the last recorded patrol. <br>
					<br>
					Any upcoming time requirements would take priority based off what is coming up as due. Then priority
					levels and time since last recorded patrol would be combined and the area randomly selected. <br>
					<br>
					A formula such as this could be used. 1 being low priority and 5 being high.<br>
					Path selection chance = priority (1-5) * last patrol (hrs)<br>
					20 (selection chance) = 5 * 4<br>
					The program would calculator that for all paths and then pick one randomly with the larger the
					number the more chance of being selected. The clockwise or counter clockwise and up or down could
					also be randomly selected.<br>
					<br>
					This means the longer an area has not been checked the greater chance of selection, but it is also
					remotely possible to double back on a location that has just been visited to keep it random. The
					higher the priority of an area the greater chance of it being selected for a patrol also. A more
					complex equation could add in other factors like time till next minimum required patrol. <br>
					<br>
					All the data would be uploaded and recorded on servers in case it ever is required, and live updates
					sent to a control room so they are aware of officer locations.<br>
					<br>
					There are more possible features such as a fall detector but that covers the basics.<br>

				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					A small device could be made that would likely be more reliable, but for wider adoption using the
					sensors and communication already built into a phone would likely be best. This would reduce both
					development requirements and adoption costs by clients.<br>
					<br>
					To start an Android focus would be preferred due to the more rugged and cheaper availability of
					phones, though room to expand to IOS could be possible later. This mean Java on the phone side would
					likely be used along with the Bluetooth and sensor technologies built in.<br>

				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Skills required</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					Some basic requirements to get started include. <br>
					<br>
					In depth Java programming skills as well as knowledge of how to write Android applications with it
					and interface them with the phone sensors. <br>
					<br>
					Web development and server knowledge to allow the phone to communicate back with a server as
					required for new instructions and to update movement history. <br>
					<br>
					A basic desktop application to allow retrieval of data and entering in new patrol variables though
					Java could likely cover this task too. <br>
					<br>
					Later the requirements could expand greatly by adding on extra peripherals.

				</div>
				<br>
				<h3>Outcome</h3><br>
				<div align=left>
					If this project was developed the basic criteria and benefits at the overview should be met.
					Security company’s seeking greater safety, efficiency and control of Security Officers would likely
					adopt it due to the low starting cost compared to most security equipment and the possible
					benefits.<br>
					<br>
					Long term hardware solutions removed from the phone completely or connected to it by Bluetooth would
					likely be developed having better durability and price advantages, or to be used in places a phone
					cannot. Integration into existing security software solutions could also be investigated opening new
					possible functionality with access control systems and alarms.
