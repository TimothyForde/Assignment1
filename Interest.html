						<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

						<p>
							<b>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
								event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b><br>
							My interest in IT is very broad and i'm looking into areas ranging from security systems to
							how USB game controllers work.<br>
							It started when my dad got an intel 486 personal computer for the household back when it
							first come out, which lead to everyone playing video games on it. I’m told I never really
							learned to read well untill I suddenly found it a requirement to play those games, and the
							game manuals back then were rather large and complex. From that time onwards I’ve always had
							a computer in the house, even if only for gaming.<br>
							These days I build and maintain my own PCs. In fact, right now I have 2 desktops I use for
							my video game streaming. One to play the game and one dedicated as a video encoder/editor.
							So far, my IT experience is hobby based with only very basic use at work.
							<br><br><b>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
							To be honest I first made plans to study with Open University Australia. As someone in the
							security industry I work 24 7 rotating shifts and from the past I knew that traditional
							study would not be possible. The ability to be able to sleep after a night shift and only
							view a lecture or tutorial after a good sleep is very important to me. I went with IT as my
							interest in the area has only been growing in the last few years with streaming. I also know
							many people already working in IT and I’m even dating a programmer. <br>
							As for RMIT itself? I’ve
							studied my engineering with them in the past and my only issues were how inflexible the
							learning was to someone working. I was very happy to find out RMIT offered just the course I
							wanted online and living only 5km or so north of the city campus I can even drop in if ever
							required.
							<br><br><b>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
							I want to take my understanding of computers from my current hobby level to a professional
							level. I want to learn all the basics of programming so that I can build on it after the
							course and work on several projects that are currently on my to-do list. I want to learn
							more about networking, databases, and all the little things that go on in the background at
							a corporate environment. <br>
							I want to gain a greater in-depth understanding of how computers
							work so I can do things like program and build Human Input Devices via USB. I want to learn
							some of the basics of how hacking and IT security works in case I want or need to learn more
							later. And last of course I want to learn enough about IT to use it in a career.
